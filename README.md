#Predicting Future Customer Engagement for an Audiobook App

Problem Statement
In this project, we tackle the challenge of predicting future customer engagement for an Audiobook app. The dataset provided encompasses customer data related exclusively to audio versions of books. Each customer in the dataset has made at least one purchase, leading to their inclusion in the database.

The dataset is presented in a structured format within a .csv file, offering several key variables for analysis. These variables include Customer ID, Book length metrics (both average and total), Price metrics (both average and total), Review status (boolean), Review score (rated out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion rate (ranging from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and the time gap between the last visit and purchase date (in days).

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can effectively predict whether a customer will make another purchase. This challenge is framed as a binary classification problem, with the target being a Boolean variable representing whether a customer will purchase (1) or not (0).

Dataset and Task Overview
The dataset's temporal nature comes into play as we consider a two-year window of historical activity and engagement data, followed by a prediction horizon of the subsequent 6 months. In essence, our aim is to forecast whether a customer will convert in the coming 6 months based on their behavior and interactions over the past 2 years. This 6-month prediction window is chosen to capture a reasonable time frame for customer decision-making. If a customer does not convert within this period, it's likely they have explored alternatives or may not resonate with the audiobook consumption model.

Approach
Our approach involves two main steps: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Building.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We begin by delving into the dataset's characteristics through EDA. This entails gaining insights into the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data. EDA involves:

Understanding the data's statistical summary.
Visualizing the distribution of numerical variables through histograms.
Identifying correlations between variables using heatmaps.
Investigating the impact of variables such as completion rate, support requests, and review scores on customer conversion.

Model Building
Following a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, we transition to building a machine-learning model. We employ a neural network for classification with the goal of predicting customer conversion. The model is designed with hidden layers and an output layer, employing activation functions tailored to capture complex relationships within the data. We train the model using a combination of historical data and target labels.

Significance and Value
The ability to predict customer engagement and conversion is of paramount importance for businesses. By focusing marketing efforts on customers likely to convert, costs can be optimized and resources more efficiently allocated. This predictive model also enables us to discern key metrics influencing customer re-engagement. By identifying potential future buyers, we can proactively cater to their preferences, ultimately leading to business growth and a richer customer experience.
